**Abstract:** California’s vision for a net-zero future by 2045 relies heavily on variable renewable energy systems. Thus, energy storage - particularly long-duration storage - could play a fundamental role in reliably supplying low-carbon electricity. We study energy storage using the BRIDGES model, a combined gas-electric capacity expansion model for California across multiple investment periods (2025-2045), modeled with progressively decreasing carbon emission targets to a zero emissions by 2045. This least-cost optimization model includes renewable gas production via power-to-gas, long-term storage of energy in gaseous form, electric energy storage such as through batteries and hydrogen storage, and renewable energy generation, all with capacity tracking and investment. Multiple scenarios are evaluated to examine the sensitivity of the optimal storage portfolio to system-level and sector-level parameters. The scenario results show that all electric energy storage systems - which vary in storage duration - are deployed and required in a net-zero California in 2045, amounting to around 75 GW of storage capacity. Lithium ion systems make up approximately 80% of this power capacity and supply most short-run storage needs. Hydrogen storage - in the form of a power-to-gas-to-power system - emerges as a replacement to conventional natural gas storage, comprising most of the total energy storage capacity (ca. 4 TWh). This capacity is less than 5% of the current natural gas storage capacity (94 TWh), indicating sufficient room for repurposing part of the gas infrastructure. A demand-side sensitivity analysis proves that higher electricity demand correlates with more builds of Li-ion batteries, while higher industrial heat demand leads to more builds of long-duration storage systems in a net-zero economy. Moreover, power-to-gas systems satisfy part of the industrial heat demand by locally supplying renewable gas, which overtakes the traditional centralized gas storage and transfers through pipelines, casting significant doubts on the future of the large-scale gas infrastructure.

[**2 | The value of enhanced geothermal systems for the energy transition in California**](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4SE01520G)

**Abstract:** Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) offer a promising solution to decarbonizing electricity grids by providing clean firm power. We use the BRIDGES gas-electric capacity expansion model – a multi-sector energy model that optimizes energy system investment, retirements, and hourly dispatch over multiple time horizons – to explore the techno-economic impacts of integrating EGS into California's electricity and gas end-use sectors. This least-cost model co-optimizes for system expansion to meet electricity and heating demands, subject to gradually decreasing emission targets to reach a net-zero economy in 2045. We evaluated multiple EGS-focused scenarios by varying drilling depth, seismic exclusion zones, and dispatch flexibility. This allowed us to determine the influence of these factors on system capacity, costs, and emission reductions. Results showed that allowing drilling depths up to 7 km yielded up to 82 GW of EGS capacity by 2045, reducing the total system capacity requirement by 40% and system costs by 8.6% compared to cases without EGS. Flexible EGS dispatch further decreased system costs by 12.3%, although it accelerated reservoir depletion in the long term. EGS also reduced reliance on power-to-gas systems and supported electrification of heating, decreasing the total power-to-gas capacity by 50% compared to cases without EGS. This study demonstrated that EGS could be a critical component in achieving California's 2045 net-zero emissions target, offering significant cost reductions and enhanced system reliability across both the electricity and gas sectors.

[**1 | Optimal Gas-Electric Energy System Decarbonization Planning**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adapen.2022.100086)

**Abstract:** As energy utilities implement climate change mitigation policies, system planners require strategies for achieving affordable emissions reductions. Coordinated planning of electric power and natural gas systems will allow synergistic investments to address cross-sector operational constraints, competing uses for net-zero emissions fuels, and shifts in energy demands across energy carriers. In this study, we develop a novel optimization program that finds the cost-minimizing mix of infrastructure expansion or reduction across gas and electric systems to satisfy sector-specific emissions constraints. Alongside energy supply resources, our framework allows for central-planning of end-use equipment stocks to allow switching between gas and electric appliances upon failure or premature replacement. The proposed model is used to simulate case study scenarios for a benchmark 24-pipe gas network coupled to a 24-node power system test network. We find that electrification of greater than 80% of core gas demands is a component of the least-cost solution for modeled energy systems. Despite this substitution, the gas system is maintained to service difficult-to-electrify customers and to deliver net-zero emissions gas to electricity generators in times of peak electricity demand. Restricting electrification of gas appliances increases reliance on power-to-gas technologies and increases annual costs by 15% in 2040. Neglecting constraints on pipeline blending of hydrogen can produce a misleading result that relies on hydrogen blend fractions of greater than 50%. In all cases, we find the average costs of delivered gas increase nearly 5-fold across the decarbonization transition, highlighting the importance of future work investigating cost-allocation strategies for ensuring an equitable energy transition.
